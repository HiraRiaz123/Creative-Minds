**Assignment: Errors Faced While Using GitHub for Project Collaboration**

During the course of my project on GitHub, I encountered several challenges related to collaboration, branching, and merging. Initially, I faced a *fatal error: permission denied by collaborator*, which prevented me from accessing parts of the repository. After some investigation, I learned that this was due to my branch not being published. Publishing my branch was essential for making it accessible to my collaborator, allowing us to merge changes and work seamlessly together.

Another issue occurred due to a branch naming inconsistency. I accidentally created two branches with my nameâ€”one with a lowercase "m" and the other with an uppercase "M". Git treated them as distinct branches, which led to confusion and errors when attempting to switch branches or merge changes. I realized that using consistent, clear branch names is crucial in avoiding such issues in future projects.

The most significant problem occurred while merging. My collaborator and I had unknowingly created files with identical names and similar content in separate branches, causing a *merge conflict*. Git was unable to automatically combine these files, so we had to resolve the conflict manually by carefully reviewing each version and deciding which changes to keep. Through this experience, I learned the importance of clear branch management, communication, and conflict resolution in collaborative projects. Each issue provided a valuable lesson for future GitHub work.
